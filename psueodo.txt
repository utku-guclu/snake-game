1.First, create the HTML structure for the game. This will include the canvas element where the game will be displayed, as well as any buttons or other elements you want to include in the game's user interface.

2.Next, style the game using CSS. This will involve setting the size and appearance of the canvas, as well as styling any buttons or other UI elements you've added.

3.Now it's time to write the JavaScript code that will make the game function. Start by creating the Snake class, which will represent the snake in the game. This class should have properties for the snake's position, velocity, and size, as well as methods for moving the snake and growing it.

4.Create the linked list data structure that will be used to store the snake's body. Each node in the linked list should contain the position and size of one segment of the snake's body.

5.Write the code for the main game loop, which will update the snake's position and redraw the canvas at a set interval. You can use the requestAnimationFrame function to create a smooth animation.

6.Add code to handle user input, so that the player can control the snake using the arrow keys.

7.Create a Food class to represent the food that the snake will eat. This class should have properties for the food's position and size, as well as a method for drawing the food on the canvas.

8.Add code to detect when the snake collides with the food, and increase the snake's size and score when this occurs.

9.Finally, add code to end the game when the snake collides with the walls of the canvas or with its own body.
